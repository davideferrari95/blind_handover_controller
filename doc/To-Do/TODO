Force-Load Transfer User Study - Experiment Details:

    Task Description:

        ✔ Robot must pass an object to the human (Different Objects / Weights / Sizes / Positions). @done(24-02-12 16:33)
        ✔ Human must take the object from the robot (Sometimes head-on, other times from behind). @done(24-02-12 16:33)
        ✔ Human must communicate when he has the object -> Robot must release the object (Button Pressure). @done(24-02-12 16:33)

        ✔ Different Objects with Different Weights and Sizes. @done(24-02-12 16:33)
        ✔ Dataset Creation without Implementing Safety (Always PFL) or Communication. @done(24-02-12 16:33)

Future Implementations:

    Handover "On Flight":

        ✔ Handover occurs while robot is moving @done(24-02-12 16:33)

    Personal Safety:

        - Comparative experiment ? with *"ISO Safety"* vs *"Personal Safety"*.
        - Training task with ISO, communication and possible interactions.

        - Define How to Change Robot Behavior in according to the User Requests.

        - Define Risk Indicators:

            - Contact risk between *human head / body* and robot is different from *human hands / arms* and robot (ISO/TS 15066 - Appendix A.2 - 29 Body Areas / 12 Body Regions).
            - If Risk Indicator is too high ⇾ Slow Down.
            - NB: Biomechanical limits (max pressure and force) in ISO/TS 15066 are based on conservative estimation and scientific research on pain sensation.

        - Experiment:

            - Robot must fill some small boxes with objects (e.g. screws / pen drives etc.).
            - User must apply a label on each box.
            - User can ask robot to *Slow Down* / *Stop* / *Move Further* / *Hurry Up*.
            - Goal for the user is to finish the task as fast as possible.

        - Collect data about the interaction:

            - Execution Time
            - Experience in Robotics
            - Trust / Confidence in the Robot / Application / Task
            - User Satisfaction / Stress / Fear / Anxiety / Frustration

        - Idea:

            - Graph with User Experience (trust / confidence) vs Robot Behavior (speed / acceleration) in relation with ISO.
            - How much the velocity / distance is further from the ISO standard.
            - How much the fear / anxiety / frustration is higher / lower.
            - Coward approach ⇾ ISO makes fear ⇾ Slow down the Robot.
