Load Transfer - FT Sensor:

    - Study the `Force-Load Transfer` between the Robot and the Human.
    - Can we use the Force-Load Transfer to detect the Handover Success ?
    - Find a Robust strategy to detect the Handover Success.

    - Little User-Study to find the Force-Load Transfer:

        - Robot pass an object to the human (Different Objects / Weights / Sizes / Positions).
        - Get the Force-Load Transfer Curve between the Robot and the Human.
        - Create a `Force-Load Transfer` Model with PyTorch.
        - Test the Model with different Objects / Weights / Sizes / Positions.

    - `Neural Network` to detect the Handover Success:

        - Use the `Force-Load Transfer` Model to detect the Handover Release.

Sensing and Communication:

    - Implement the `6IMPOSE` Object Recognition.
    - Implement the `Alexa Conversations` or `Gesture Recognition` for the Handover Request.
    - Implement the Handover Procedure with the `Automatic Success Detection` and `Release` of the Object.

Future Implementations:

    Personal Safety:

        - Comparative experiment ? with *"ISO Safety"* vs *"Personal Safety"*.
        - Training task with ISO, communication and possible interactions.

        - Define How to Change Robot Behavior in according to the User Requests.

        - Define Risk Indicators:

            - Contact risk between *human head / body* and robot is different from *human hands / arms* and robot (ISO/TS 15066 - Appendix A.2 - 29 Body Areas / 12 Body Regions).
            - If Risk Indicator is too high ⇾ Slow Down.
            - NB: Biomechanical limits (max pressure and force) in ISO/TS 15066 are based on conservative estimation and scientific research on pain sensation.

        - Experiment:

            - Robot must fill some small boxes with objects (e.g. screws / pen drives etc.).
            - User must apply a label on each box.
            - User can ask robot to *Slow Down* / *Stop* / *Move Further* / *Hurry Up*.
            - Goal for the user is to finish the task as fast as possible.

        - Collect data about the interaction:

            - Execution Time
            - Experience in Robotics
            - Trust / Confidence in the Robot / Application / Task
            - User Satisfaction / Stress / Fear / Anxiety / Frustration

        - Idea:

            - Graph with User Experience (trust / confidence) vs Robot Behavior (speed / acceleration) in relation with ISO.
            - How much the velocity / distance is further from the ISO standard.
            - How much the fear / anxiety / frustration is higher / lower.
            - Coward approach ⇾ ISO makes fear ⇾ Slow down the Robot.
